# Monitoring SSIS Projects Scripts

The scripts in this folder can be used to query the built in logs for SQL Server Integration Services.

It is suggested you copy them into a folder and create a SQL Server Management Studio Solution to house them.

These are demonstrated in Module 9, Using the Catalog for Logging.

Please see the [Read Me](Documentation/ReadMe.md) file in the Documentation folder for more information.
