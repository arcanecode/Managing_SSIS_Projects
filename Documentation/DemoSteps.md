# Demo Steps

The "DemoSteps" documents contain the steps needed to recreate many of the demos. Note that in no way should they be used as a replacement for the video course. 

These are used as a reminder of the steps that need to be done during the filming of the course, not a tutorial. It contains no explanations, those are found in the video. 

However, we have included these in the documenation as they may aid in stimulating your memory as you manage your own SSIS Projects.
